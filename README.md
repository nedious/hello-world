## note on using github to track tangible progress toward a goal, daily

### goal:
1. make a change to a github repository daily to make incremental growth toward goal
2. have a why for why the goal is important
3. have a countdown to a deadline to post daily on paper in full display to make the deadline real
4. have a check list of 3 thing I am committed to doing daily. Incremental improvement
5. avoid perfection, pursue minimal viable product, pursue **simplicity**
